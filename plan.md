# Plan

## Status
Current phase: Phase 33
Current task: 33.3 — Run survey and analyze results

---

## Phases

### Phases 1-24: Foundation through End-to-End Live Verification (all done)

### Phase 25: Chrome cd Injection — Validate Token Structure (done)

### Phase 26: Realistic Fingerprint Profile (deprioritized)

### Phase 27: VM Parser Extension for New Templates (pending)

### Phase 28: End-to-End CAPTCHA Solve — Token Isolation (done)
> Standalone token accepted by server (errorCode 0) via Puppeteer request interception.

### Phase 29: Cache Refresh & TLS Verification (done)
> All 10 templates refreshed. cap_union_new_show 403 was missing sess, not TLS.
> Full headless flow confirmed possible.

### Phase 30: Puppeteer-Free Domain Query (done)
> `node scraper/cli.js --verbose https://example.com` works end-to-end.
> CAPTCHA solve + urlsec query with zero Puppeteer dependency. Confirmed 2026-04-11.

### Phase 31: Auto-Port Unknown Templates in Scraper (done)
> When the scraper encounters an unknown template, automatically run the porting
> pipeline as a subprocess, cache the result, and retry — instead of failing.
> Confirmed working 2026-04-11.

### Phase 32: Switch Template Cache Key to Source Hash (done)
> TDC_NAME is not a reliable cache key — same TDC_NAME can map to different XTEA
> params across builds (confirmed in 28.13/28.14). Replaced with SHA-256 hash of
> tdc.js source after stripping the eks token. Cache cleared and re-seeded. 2026-04-12.

### Phase 33: TDC Survey — Collect Live Template Data
> Clear the cache, run the scraper repeatedly, save each unique tdc.js build,
> record which builds port successfully vs fail, and which still get errorCode 12.
> Output a structured report for analysis.

## Current Task

**ID**: 33.3
**Title**: Run survey and analyze results
**Phase**: TDC Survey — Collect Live Template Data
**Status**: in-progress

### Goal
Run `node scripts/tdc-survey.js --attempts 30 --verbose --save-sources` and analyze the results. This is a manual/interactive task — the director runs the survey and interprets the output.

### Verification
- [ ] Survey completes without fatal errors
- [ ] Report saved to `output/tdc-survey/report.json`
- [ ] Summary table reviewed and findings documented

### Suggested Agent
none (director runs this directly)
