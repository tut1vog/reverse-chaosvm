# Plan

## Status
Current phase: Phase 39 — vm-slide stack VM
Current task: none — PAUSED after 39.2 for mid-track strategy call on 39.3 scope

---

## Phases

### Phase 38: Restructure (Stream A — blocking)
> Reorganize the repo around the research phase. Preserve git history via `git mv`, rewrite `require()` paths, keep `npm test` at 296/296 as the pass/fail gate.

| ID | Task | Status |
|----|------|--------|
| 38.1 | Restructure repo into research/ + tools/ layout (git mv + require rewrites + package.json + README) | done |
| 38.2 | Create placeholder README.md files for the 5 research tracks | done |
| 38.3 | Triage `scripts/` one-offs into research tracks or bench | done |
| 38.4 | Fix latent string-literal path misses from 38.1 (survey.js, diagnose.js) | done |
| 38.5 | Move the 5 previously-ambiguous scripts to their decided homes (user-confirmed 2026-04-12) | done |

### Phase 39: vm-slide stack VM (Stream B — Track 1, top priority)
> Decompile `sample/vm_slide.js` — stack-based ChaosVM variant (`__TENCENT_CHAOS_STACK`). Produce decoder, disassembler, opcode table, architecture doc, and a top-level variants comparison.

| ID | Task | Status |
|----|------|--------|
| 39.1 | Implement vm-slide decoder + disassembler under `research/vm-slide-stack-vm/` | done |
| 39.2 | Write tests for vm-slide decoder + disassembler | done |
| 39.3 | Write `docs/VM_SLIDE_ARCHITECTURE.md` + `docs/VM_SLIDE_OPCODES.md` from verified findings | pending |
| 39.4 | Write `docs/CHAOSVM_VARIANTS.md` — top-level register-vs-stack comparison | pending |

## Current Task

**PAUSED** — awaiting user mid-track strategy call on 39.3 scope.

39.1 + 39.2 are done (decoder, disassembler, 16 tests pinning current behavior). The critical open question for 39.3 is whether to expand it to include a control-flow-aware disassembly upgrade (the current linear walker covers only ~2% of the bytecode before halting on a legitimate dispatch hole), or keep 39.3 narrowly scoped to documenting what we currently see and defer the walker upgrade to a separate task. See the dispatch notes for details.
