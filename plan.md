# Plan

## Status
Current phase: Phase 44 — vm-slide plaintext fingerprint reversal (**PLAN REVISION NEEDED** — 44.2 found the plaintext is built outside vm-slide)
Current task: — (none; awaiting user confirmation of Phase 44 scope pivot)

**Phase 43 closed 2026-04-13** in dispatch order 43.0 ✅ → 43.1 ✅ → 43.2 ✅ → 43.3 ✅ → 43.4 ✅ → 43.5 ✅. Cipher half of vm-slide's vData is now byte-identical reproducible via `tools/vdata-generator/` against both jsdom and real Chrome 146 HAR fixtures.

**Phase 44 dispatch order** (user-confirmed 2026-04-13, 9-task variant): 44.1 → 44.2 → 44.3 → **44.3.5** → 44.4 → **44.5a → 44.5b** → 44.6 → 44.7. User picked all three director recommendations: real-Chrome differential capture as a third fixture (44.3.5), per-run order resolution treated as required (44.4 is blocking, not optional), and the 44.5 builder split into replay-with-substitution (44.5a, ships first) plus full-synthesis (44.5b, depends on 44.4). Stream A (44.1-44.4) is discovery — pins the field schema. Stream B (44.5a-44.7) is the deliverable.

**Dispatch policy for Phase 44**: the user has explicitly asked the director NOT to auto-continue into 44.1 after this plan revision. The director will Orient and present a "ready to dispatch 44.1?" prompt on the next user message; dispatch only fires when the user explicitly says go. Phase 43 narrowed on 2026-04-13 to the cipher half of the vData pipeline only — the plaintext-fingerprint half moved to the new Phase 44 track per user Option C. The generator ships as a pure re-encoder that consumes a plaintext byte buffer and emits the 152-char vData string byte-for-byte; Phase 44 will reverse the fingerprint build separately if/when the user wants it.

**Phase 43 recommendation (user-confirmed 2026-04-13)**: use the existing `tools/scraper/vdata-harness.js` jsdom harness as the dynamic oracle for test-time validation. Puppeteer live capture via `tools/captcha-solver/live-submit.js` kept as an optional tail-validation vector in 43.4.

### Phase 43: Standalone vData cipher encoder (narrowed 2026-04-13, in progress)
> Ship `tools/vdata-generator/` — a standalone white-box reimplementation of the **cipher half** of vm-slide's vData pipeline: XTEA encrypt + standard base64 (custom 65-char alphabet, index 64 = padding). Consumes a pre-computed 112-byte plaintext and emits the 152-char vData string byte-for-byte. Does NOT produce new vData from scratch — it is a pure encoder. The plaintext-fingerprint half moved to Phase 44 per user Option C (2026-04-13).

> **Established facts** (43.1 + 43.2): XTEA key `2e430f8c15b7da96` (16 ASCII bytes, bytecode constant). Classical XTEA, 32 rounds, delta `0x9E3779B9`, little-endian uint32 packing. Pipeline = 14 × 8-byte XTEA blocks (= 112 bytes) → 152 chars of standard base64 with custom alphabet `GV5yc1_twaSpHPOE7R3jv9fqC2L-0TxMi4FuolBAbQeIgJU*XzZKWkDNh6n8dsrmY` (length 65, index 64 `Y` = padding char, RFC 4648 role of `=`). 112 bytes need 2 padding chars → every vData ends in `YY`. **Correction from 43.1**: there is NO `10 40` trailer — that was a mis-decoding of the `YY` padding as raw 6-bit values (`(64<<6)|64 = 0x1040`). Real encoder is standard base64 with `isNaN`-guarded padding at bytecode pcs 17084..17418. Verified by 43.2 against both jsdom and HAR reference vectors, byte-for-byte both directions.

| ID | Task | Status |
|----|------|--------|
| 43.0 | Rename `tools/scraper/vdata-generator.js` → `tools/scraper/vdata-harness.js` + update all imports (director-owned) | done |
| 43.1 | Hybrid static+dynamic XTEA/plaintext extraction via jsdom harness instrumentation + Phase 40 walker cross-check | done |
| 43.2 | Freeze deterministic jsdom + HAR fixtures under `tests/fixtures/`; re-verify custom base64 alphabet length directly from `output/vm-slide/bytecode.json` at pc 16932 | done |
| 43.3 | Standalone cipher encoder `tools/vdata-generator/{xtea.js, custom-base64.js, encode.js, cli.js}` — pure JS, no jsdom/vm-slide dep, byte-identical against both fixtures | done |
| 43.4 | Tests for the encoder (different agent per impl/tests separation) — byte-identical assertions against both fixtures + unit tests for XTEA and custom base64 | done |
| 43.5 | Docs — new `docs/VDATA_FORMAT.md` (authoritative byte-level spec), update `docs/CAPTCHA_ORCHESTRATOR.md` §6, track README + CLAUDE.md Documentation table bumps (director-owned) | done |

### Phase 44: vm-slide plaintext fingerprint reversal (planned 2026-04-13, awaiting user dispatch trigger)
> Reverse the JS-environment fingerprint builder inside vm-slide's `proxyXHR` body so that vData can be generated end-to-end from scratch (combining with the Phase 43 cipher encoder). Two streams: **Stream A (44.1-44.4)** is discovery — pin the field schema. **Stream B (44.5a-44.7)** is the deliverable — standalone plaintext builder + tests + docs.

> **Established facts (Phase 43.1, 43.2)**:
> - Plaintext is exactly 112 bytes. Always.
> - Structure: 8 `key=value` pairs joined by `&` (exactly 8 `=`, exactly 7 `&`).
> - Per-run byte order varies; per-run character multiset is invariant. Three independent jsdom runs against `{a:'1'}`, `{foo:'bar'}`, and the full HAR field set all produced the same multiset → the plaintext is **independent of the verify POST field set**.
> - jsdom multiset and real-Chrome HAR multiset have the same shape (8`=`/7`&`) but different content (jsdom has spaces/parens/apostrophes; HAR has digits/`k`s) → the plaintext is a **runtime fingerprint that diverges between environments**, not a constant.
> - Encrypt closure entry pc **15241**; created at pc 15404 by `OP_58 15241 0 2 3 4`. Captured live by `research/vm-slide-stack-vm/vdata-dynamic-trace.js`. Each run produces exactly 14 encrypt calls (= 14 × 8 = 112 bytes).
> - The encrypt closure is reached via the module-export table — not invoked inline at the FUNC_CREATE site. Caller path is opaque to static analysis without back-walking.

> **Open questions (Phase 44 owns)**:
> 1. Which 8 fields exist? What are their names?
> 2. What value-source rule does each field follow? (`typeof`, property read, object stringification, `Function.toString()`, ...)
> 3. What governs the per-run byte-order variability? (memory-iteration order vs internal salt vs both)
> 4. Why is the multiset invariant if the order is not? (engineered constants vs derived from a fixed environment)
> 5. Why exactly 112 bytes? (engineered field widths, padding, truncation?)

> **Starting inputs**: `output/vm-slide/bytecode.json` (24,273 elements), `output/vm-slide/disassembly-full.txt` (Phase 40.1 walker output), `research/vm-slide-stack-vm/{walker,decoder,disassembler}.js`, `research/vm-slide-stack-vm/vdata-dynamic-trace.js` (live oracle), `tests/fixtures/vdata-{jsdom,har}-capture.json` (ground truth — both fixtures contain the captured 112-byte plaintext for cross-checking decompile hypotheses).

| ID | Task | Status |
|----|------|--------|
| 44.1 | Encrypt-callsite back-walk + plaintext-build call graph (static + runtime caller-PC capture) | done |
| 44.2 | Plaintext-build static decompile to pseudocode — `research/vm-slide-stack-vm/PLAINTEXT-BUILD.md` | done |
| 44.3 | Dynamic property-read instrumentation — tap OP_47/OP_60/string-build inside the plaintext-build pc range, dump every `(object, key, value)` tuple, cross-check against the captured 112-byte plaintext to identify the 8 fields | pending |
| 44.3.5 | Real-Chrome differential capture via Puppeteer — capture a third fixture from production Chrome using the `tools/captcha-solver/` infrastructure; cross-validate the schema from 44.3 against a non-jsdom environment | pending |
| 44.4 | Per-run order resolution — run the instrumented harness ≥20 times across both jsdom and real Chrome, determine whether order varies (memory iteration) or content varies (internal salt); blocking for 44.5b | pending |
| 44.5a | Standalone plaintext builder — replay-with-substitution. `tools/vdata-generator/build-plaintext.js` (initial form) reads a captured plaintext + a field-value override map and emits a substituted 112-byte plaintext. Early Stream-B checkpoint that validates the schema from 44.2/44.3 without depending on 44.4. | pending |
| 44.5b | Standalone plaintext builder — full synthesis. Extends 44.5a with a from-scratch builder that reads a JS environment description and emits a fresh 112-byte plaintext matching the order distribution from 44.4. Adds `--from-env` CLI flag. Depends on 44.4. | pending |
| 44.6 | Tests for the plaintext builder (different agent per impl/tests separation) — unit tests per field source rule + integration tests asserting byte-identical reproduction of all three fixtures' plaintexts → vData strings end-to-end (jsdom + HAR + real-Chrome from 44.3.5) | pending |
| 44.7 | Docs closeout (director-owned) — expand `docs/VDATA_FORMAT.md` §1 with the now-complete plaintext spec; mark Phase 44 closed in `plan.md` + `research/vm-slide-stack-vm/README.md`; bump `CLAUDE.md` Project Memory to record full end-to-end byte-identical vData reproducibility | pending |

> **Scope decisions (user-confirmed 2026-04-13)**: 9-task variant. (1) Real-Chrome differential capture **YES** → 44.3.5 added. (2) Per-run order resolution **REQUIRED**, not nice-to-have → 44.4 is blocking for 44.5b. (3) 44.5 builder design **BOTH** → split into 44.5a (replay-with-substitution, ships first) + 44.5b (full synthesis, depends on 44.4). User explicitly asked the director to record this decision but **NOT auto-dispatch** 44.1 — dispatch is on user trigger only.

## Current Task

— None. Phase 44 pivot pending user review (see history/20260413.md entry "44.2: plan pivot — plaintext lives in orchestrator, not vm-slide").

**Situation**: 44.2's decompile of fn 15918 proved vm-slide is a **pure encrypt stage** — fn 20539 (the proxyXHR send-handler) intercepts `xhr.send(body)`, passes `body` (already the 112-byte plaintext) to fn 15918 as arg 0, and fn 15918's 14-iteration loop just XTEA-encrypts that buffer 8 bytes at a time. The fingerprint plaintext is therefore assembled by the **captcha orchestrator** (Phase 41 `t_captcha_slide.js`, likely module 56), NOT by vm-slide. Tasks 44.3/44.4 as originally written targeted bytecode instrumentation inside vm-slide's plaintext-build region — that region does not exist.

**What still holds**:
- 44.3.5 (real-Chrome differential capture via Puppeteer) — still valid and still useful as a third fixture; the capture target shifts from "vm-slide fingerprint" to "orchestrator pre-encrypt body".
- 44.5a (replay-with-substitution plaintext builder) — still valid; it consumes a captured 112-byte plaintext and emits a substituted one. Agnostic to where the plaintext was built.
- 44.6 / 44.7 (tests + docs closeout) — structurally still valid.

**What needs to change**:
- 44.3: retarget from vm-slide bytecode instrumentation to **orchestrator JS-level tracing**. Use Phase 41's `docs/CAPTCHA_ORCHESTRATOR.md` module map + the existing Puppeteer harness to hook `XMLHttpRequest.prototype.send` *before* vm-slide's proxyXHR wraps it, capture the plaintext `body` string at the hook site, and back-walk in JS to find which orchestrator function assembled it.
- 44.4: per-run order resolution still matters but now targets **JS iteration semantics** (likely `for (k in obj)` or `Object.keys()` order over a fingerprint object) rather than VM-internal order.
- 44.5b: full synthesis becomes a JS-environment fingerprint builder mirroring the orchestrator's logic — completely different codebase than a bytecode walker.

**Also flagged for follow-up**: 44.2's static decompile surfaced a "slot 4 contradiction" inside fn 15918 (first-loop treats slot 4 as a 16-byte sliceable buffer, but fn 20539 demonstrably passes `{py:"0"|"1"}` at the call site). One plausible reading: the first loop is XTEA key expansion over a 16-byte key constant that is supplied via an upvalue under some other path, and the `{py}` arg takes a different local slot at runtime. Not blocking — 44.3's JS-level trace will incidentally resolve it or push it to a separate micro-task.

**Director recommends** user confirm the pivot and let the director redraft Phase 44 tasks 44.3..44.5b against the orchestrator target before dispatching anything further.
